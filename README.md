## Data

The data ca-dmv-bot uses is sourced from [@veltman/ca-license-plates](https://github.com/veltman/ca-license-plates), which states;

- 23,463 personalized license plate applications that the [California DMV](https://dmv.ca.gov) received from 2015 through 2016
- These aren't **all** applications reviewed by the DMV during that timeframe; only applications that were flagged for additional review by the Review Committee
- Compiled from 458 Excel workbooks that the DMV prepared for a public records request

## Notes

- Uses Discord to manually approve plates (to ensure no obscene content gets posted, such as slurs)
- Uses GraphicsMagick (fork of ImageMagick) to generate images
- Does not include review reason codes for brevity purposes
- Made on a slow weekend; only ephemeral logging exists and there is little-to-no error checking
